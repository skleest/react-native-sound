import {Sound} from '@vovkasm/react-native-sound';

let whoosh
Sound.load(require('./whoosh.mp3')).then(player => {
  whoosh = player
  console.log('duration in seconds: ' + whoosh.getDuration() +
      'number of channels: ' + whoosh.getNumberOfChannels());  
}).catch(error => {
  console.log('failed to load the sound', error);
});

// Play the sound with an onEnd callback
whoosh.play((success) => {
  if (success) {
    console.log('successfully finished playing');
  } else {
    console.log('playback failed due to audio decoding errors');
  }
});

// Reduce the volume by half
whoosh.setVolume(0.5);

// Position the sound to the full right in a stereo field
whoosh.setPan(1);

// Loop indefinitely until stop() is called
whoosh.setNumberOfLoops(-1);

// Get properties of the player instance
console.log('volume: ' + whoosh.getVolume());
console.log('pan: ' + whoosh.getPan());
console.log('loops: ' + whoosh.getNumberOfLoops());

// Enable playback in silence mode (iOS only)
// Sound.enableInSilenceMode(true);

// Seek to a specific point in seconds
whoosh.setCurrentTime(2.5);

// Get the current playback point in seconds
whoosh.getCurrentTime((seconds) => console.log('at ' + seconds));

// Pause the sound
whoosh.pause();

// Stop the sound and rewind to the beginning
whoosh.stop();

// Release the audio player resource
